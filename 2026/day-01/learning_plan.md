**90-day personal DevOps learning plan**

What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

- Currently mostly MNC companies migrating from on-premise server(prefer) to cloud. As it is most effective and save time and cost on maintainence. So learning cloud will give an add-on to the career, whereas mostly MNC companies are using Devops so its a good opportunity for me as developer to gain the knowledge on Operational side also to understand the full fledge picture of application till client end side.

Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
-  For upskilling my skills as i am already working in docker and kubernates in my current project but want to explore more and deep dive into this so that in future i can make it as my career path

Where do you want to reach?
-  I want to make carrer in this field so that i can become expert in this area as well as to gain some certifications like CKA that will help me in my career growth

How you will stay consistent every single day?
-  I am planning to give atleast 2 hours a day to be more consistent as well as to utilise my weekends to give more time in this area. In Addition to these i will make some To-Do List during my starting days so that it will keep reminding me to be more consitent in this course.
